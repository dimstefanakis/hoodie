Matches the "cool" factor of the image without crossing into "cringe" territory. We are shifting from **"Anime Warrior"** to **"Dark Luxury / Atmospheric Streetwear."**

Here is the revised `PRODUCT.md`. It keeps the _Eclipse_ branding but sounds like a high-end fashion drop rather than a roleplay costume.

# PRODUCT.md - The Eclipse Cloak (Refined Strategy)

## 1. Core Identity & Positioning

- **Product Name:** The Eclipse Cloak
- **Internal Concept:** "The Wearable Void"
- **Category:** Premium Loungewear / Statement Outerwear
- **Price Point:** $149.00 USD
- **Core Value Proposition:** The comfort of a weighted blanket, elevated into a structured, high-fashion silhouette. It allows you to disappear in plain sight.
- **Differentiation:** Generic wearable blankets look sloppy and childish. The Eclipse Cloak looks intentional, mysterious, and expensive.

## 2. Visual & Physical Attributes

- **Color:** Pitch Black (Light-absorbing).
- **Texture Contrast:**
- _Exterior:_ Wild, high-pile faux fur (adds volume and visual weight).
- _Interior:_ Velvet-soft plush lining (hidden comfort).

- **Silhouette:** Triangular, oversized drape. Designed to look like a "shadow" when stationary and flow heavily when moving.
- **Key Feature:** The Deep Hood. Oversized construction that naturally falls over the eyes if desired.

## 3. Brand Voice & Tone

- **The Vibe:** Dark Luxury, Quiet Confidence, Solitude.
- **The Voice:** Minimalist, Descriptive, Calm.
- **Keywords:** Void, Silence, Heavyweight, Drape, Immersion, Static.
- **Toned Down Approach:** Avoid "warrior" or "fighting monsters" rhetoric. Focus on **atmosphere** and **feeling**. It’s not armor for battle; it’s a barrier against the noise/cold.

## 4. The Customer Avatar

- **Archetype:** "The Aesthetics Curator."
- **Demographics:** 20–35 years old.
- **Psychographics:**
- Appreciates "Darkwear" or "Opium" aesthetics (Rick Owens, dark streetwear).
- Values privacy and personal space.
- Wants to look "cool" even when rotting on the couch or grabbing coffee at night.

## 5. Marketing Hooks & Angles

### Angle A: The "Elevated Comfort" (vs. The Blanket Hoodie)

- _Concept:_ Most loungewear is ugly. This is style.
- _Copy Focus:_ "Stop wearing shapeless fleece. Wear a silhouette."
- _Headline:_ "Loungewear that doesn't look lazy."

### Angle B: The "Sensory Shield" (Introvert Appeal)

- _Concept:_ The world is loud/cold. Inside the cloak, it is quiet/warm.
- _Copy Focus:_ "Your personal void." "Silence the noise."
- _Headline:_ "Disappear into comfort."

### Angle C: The "Tactile Luxury" (Price Justification)

- _Concept:_ It costs $149 because it's heavy and premium.
- _Copy Focus:_ "Heavyweight warmth." "Double-sided premium texture." "Feels like a cloud, looks like a shadow."
