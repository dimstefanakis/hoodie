</context>

<design_philosophy>
Create a design that would win design awards. Avoid the "AI slop" aesthetic at all costs:
- NO purple/blue gradients on white backgrounds
- NO generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui)
- NO predictable hero-CTA-features-testimonials templates
- NO generic geometric shapes or abstract blobs
- NO stock-looking imagery or clichéd visuals
</design_philosophy>

<aesthetic_direction>
Choose ONE distinctive aesthetic approach and commit fully:

Option A: <aesthetic_approach_A>
Option B: <aesthetic_approach_B>
Option C: <aesthetic_approach_C>
Option D: <aesthetic_approach_D>
Option E: <aesthetic_approach_E>

Pick the most unexpected yet appropriate choice and execute it with conviction.

<required_sections>
Build these sections with creative interpretation:

1. **Hero Section**
   - A hook that creates immediate intrigue
   - Interactive element that demonstrates capability
   - Clear value proposition in ≤12 words
   - Primary CTA: "<primary_cta>"
   - Trust signals (logos, security badges)

2. **Problem/Solution Narrative**
   - Tell a story, don't list features
   - Use scroll-triggered reveals for dramatic effect
   - Include real-world scenario visualization

3. **Product Showcase**
   - Interactive demo preview or animated mockup
   - Show the product in action visually
   - Technical credibility indicators

4. **Social Proof**
   - Testimonials from target personas
   - Metrics that matter to <target_audience>
   - Customer grid with hover states

5. **Technical Differentiators**
   - Clean comparison or feature grid
   - Integration/API preview (if applicable)
   - Security & compliance badges

6. **Conversion Section**
   - Secondary CTA with urgency
   - Quick form (Name, Email, Company)
   - Alternative action: "<secondary_cta>"

7. **Footer**
   - Minimal, sophisticated
   - Essential links only
   - Newsletter capture
</required_sections>

<technical_requirements>
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Mobile-responsive (fluid typography, adaptive layouts)
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Page load animations with staggered reveals (use animation-delay)
- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered effects
- Micro-interactions on hover states
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Performance-optimized (no heavy libraries)
- Load Google Fonts for typography
</technical_requirements>

<motion_design>
Implement these animation principles:
- **Page Load**: Orchestrated reveal sequence (0ms → 200ms → 400ms stagger)
- **Scroll**: Fade-in-up with subtle parallax on key visuals
- **Hover**: Scale transforms, color transitions, underline animations
- **Interactive**: Cursor-following effects, magnetic buttons
- **Background**: Subtle ambient motion (floating particles, gradient shifts)
</motion_design>

<color_guidance>
If you choose a dark theme:
- Deep background: #0a0a0f to #12121a range
- Text: Pure white (#ffffff) for headlines, muted (#a0a0a0) for body
- Accent: ONE bold color used sparingly (electric cyan, hot coral, acid green)

If you choose a light theme:
- Background: Off-white or cream (not pure white)
- Text: Deep charcoal (not pure black)
- Accent: Bold, unexpected (terracotta, forest, sapphire)
</color_guidance>

<typography_direction>
Pick a distinctive combination:
- Headlines: Display serif (Playfair Display) or Geometric sans (Clash Display, Cabinet Grotesk)
- Body: Readable with character (Source Serif Pro, Satoshi)
- Mono: JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono for technical elements

Avoid at all costs: Inter, Roboto, Arial, SF Pro, Open Sans
</typography_direction>

<thinking_process>
Before coding, briefly outline:
1. Which aesthetic direction you're choosing and why
2. The specific font pairing
3. The color palette (hex values)
4. The hero hook concept
5. One unique interactive element you'll implement

Then build the complete page.
